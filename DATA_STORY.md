> *Analyses & Visualization of Big Data — University of Barcelona*

## Prologue: The Hidden Signal

Between 2016 and 2025, over 1.4 billion prescriptions were filled across Catalunya—each one a tiny signal of human need, each one aggregated into patterns that tell a story far larger than any individual case.

But one pattern stands out above all others: **the relentless rise of medications for the nervous system**. What begins as painkillers in childhood morphs into antidepressants in young adulthood, anxiolytics in midlife, and a complex cocktail of neurological treatments in old age. This is not just data—it's a mirror reflecting how modern life, aging, and crisis reshape our collective mental health.

## Chapter 1: The Life Course Journey

### Childhood: When Pain is Simple

In the earliest years of life, the nervous system category tells a straightforward story: **90-95% of all nervous-system prescriptions are simple analgesics**—fever reducers, painkillers for scraped knees, medications for ear infections. The mind is not yet the primary concern; the body's immediate needs dominate.

But even here, a subtle signal emerges: respiratory medications peak in winter months, anti-infectives spike during flu seasons. The data captures the rhythm of childhood—seasonal, episodic, acute.

### Adolescence: The First Transition

Around age 10-17, something remarkable happens. The composition of nervous-system medications **diversifies dramatically**:

- **Analgesics plummet** from 95% to just 30% of prescriptions
- **Psychoanaleptics (antidepressants, stimulants) explode**—particularly ADHD medications, which show a strong male bias
- **Anxiolytics enter the picture** for the first time
- **Antiepileptics stabilize** as neurological conditions are diagnosed

This is the first major pharmacological transition: **the shift from physical pain to mental health**. The data reveals what parents and teachers observe daily—adolescence is when anxiety, depression, and attention disorders first manifest pharmacologically.

### Young Adulthood (20-35): The Peak of Mental Health Medication

Here, the story reaches its first crescendo. **Antidepressants and anxiolytics dominate** the nervous-system category, forming the largest share of prescriptions. This age group—traditionally seen as the healthiest—shows the highest relative burden of mental-health medications.

The data tells us:

- Depression and anxiety peak in early adulthood
- Sleep disorders become pharmacologically visible
- ADHD treatments persist into adulthood
- The "mental health load" of the population is highest here

**This is not a failure of youth—it's a recognition of need.** The data validates what mental health professionals have long observed: the transition to adulthood, with its pressures of education, career, relationships, and independence, creates a perfect storm for mental health challenges.

### Midlife (35-60): The Chronic Pain + Mental Health Era

In midlife, the pattern shifts again. The nervous-system category becomes a **blended landscape**:

- **Antidepressants and anxiolytics remain very high** (slightly declining after 45)
- **Opioids rise gradually**—chronic pain from musculoskeletal issues, postsurgical pain, degenerative conditions
- **Hypnotics and sedatives stay elevated**—insomnia becomes a persistent companion
- **Anti-dementia drugs appear** at low levels around late 50s—the first whispers of neurodegeneration

This is the era of **chronicity**: conditions that began in youth persist, new physical ailments emerge, and the pharmacological burden compounds. The data reveals midlife as a period of **accumulation**—not just of wealth or responsibilities, but of medical needs.

### Older Age (60-85+): The Triple Burden

In the final chapters of life, the nervous-system category tells a story of **three converging forces**:

1. **Chronic pain**—opioids spike significantly, reflecting degenerative pain, cancer pain, end-of-life care
2. **Neurodegeneration**—antiparkinsonian and anti-dementia medications become visible
3. **Persistent psychiatric needs**—sedatives, anxiolytics, and antidepressants remain substantial

The data shows that aging doesn't eliminate mental health needs—it **transforms and amplifies them**. The oldest adults face a triple burden: pain, neurodegeneration, and psychiatric symptoms, all requiring pharmacological management.

## Chapter 2: The Gender Divide

The data reveals a **stark gender asymmetry** in how nervous-system medications are used:

### Childhood: The ADHD Signal

**Ages 6-15**: Males use **far more** psychoanaleptics (primarily ADHD medications). The data shows a clear blue band in the gender difference heatmap—boys are diagnosed and treated for ADHD at much higher rates than girls.

This reflects a known diagnostic bias: ADHD presents differently in girls (often as inattention rather than hyperactivity), leading to underdiagnosis. The data captures not just biology, but **how medical systems see and treat different genders**.

### Adulthood: The Depression-Anxiety Divide

**Ages 18-65**: The pattern flips dramatically. **Females use significantly more antidepressants and anxiolytics** than males. The heatmap shows a strong red signal—women are prescribed mental health medications at much higher rates.

The data reveals:

- **Analgesics**: Females use more in adolescence and adulthood (migraines, dysmenorrhea, chronic pain conditions)
- **Psychoanaleptics**: Female excess in adulthood (depression, anxiety)
- **Psycholeptics**: Slight male excess in teens, female excess in midlife

This gender divide is not just about biology—it reflects **social factors**: women may be more likely to seek help, doctors may be more likely to prescribe to women, and women may face different stressors (caregiving, work-life balance, hormonal changes).

### The Unseen Burden

The data suggests that **women carry a disproportionate pharmacological burden** for mental health across most of adulthood. This is not necessarily because women have more mental illness—it may reflect differences in help-seeking, diagnostic patterns, or social expectations.

## Chapter 3: The COVID-19 Disruption

The year 2020 marks a **visible inflection point** in the prescription data. Mental health prescriptions, which had been growing steadily at 2-3% per year, **accelerated dramatically**:

- **2019-2020**: +565,103 prescriptions (2.9% increase)
- **2020-2021**: +759,283 prescriptions (3.7% increase) — **the largest single-year jump**
- **2021-2022**: +540,286 prescriptions (2.6% increase)

The data captures what epidemiologists and mental health professionals observed: **the pandemic created a mental health crisis within a public health crisis**.

### The Age-Specific Impact

The year-to-year change heatmap reveals that **not all age groups were affected equally**:

- **Young adults (20-35)**: Showed the largest increases—the age group already most burdened by mental health medications saw the biggest jump
- **Midlife (45-60)**: Moderate increases, reflecting accumulated stress from work, caregiving, and health concerns
- **Older adults (65+)**: Smaller but still significant increases, possibly reflecting isolation, fear, and grief

The data tells us that **COVID-19 didn't create new mental health needs—it amplified existing vulnerabilities**. The age groups already using the most mental health medications saw the largest increases.

### The Compositional Shift

Beyond raw numbers, the data shows a **compositional shift** in mental health medications during COVID-19:

- **Antidepressants** maintained their dominance but grew faster
- **Anxiolytics** showed particularly strong growth—reflecting pandemic-induced anxiety
- **Hypnotics and sedatives** increased—sleep disorders became more common

The pandemic didn't just increase the volume of mental health prescriptions—it **changed the mix**, with anxiety and sleep medications growing faster than depression treatments.

## Chapter 4: The Geographic Mosaic

Catalunya is not a monolith. The prescription data reveals **striking regional variations** in how medications are used:

### The Urban-Rural Divide

When normalized by population, the data shows that **different regions have different pharmacological profiles**:

- **Barcelona Metropolitan Area**: Higher absolute numbers, but when normalized, shows distinct patterns—possibly reflecting different demographics, access to care, or urban stressors
- **Rural regions**: May show different patterns of polypharmacy, access to specialists, or population age structures

### The Regional Medication Mix

The heatmap of regional medication composition reveals that **not all regions use the same mix of mental health medications**. Some regions show:

- Higher relative use of antidepressants
- Different patterns of anxiolytic use
- Regional variations in antipsychotic prescriptions

These differences could reflect:

- **Demographic differences** (age structure, socioeconomic status)
- **Healthcare access** (availability of psychiatrists, primary care patterns)
- **Cultural factors** (stigma, help-seeking behaviors)
- **Socioeconomic factors** (stress, unemployment, social support)

### The Unanswered Questions

The geographic data raises questions that the current analysis cannot fully answer:

- Do wealthier regions use more mental health medications (better access) or fewer (better social support)?
- Do urban areas show different patterns due to stressors or due to better diagnostic access?
- How do regional healthcare policies affect prescription patterns?

## Chapter 5: The Economic Dimension

Behind every prescription is a **financial transaction**. The data reveals the economic burden of mental health medications:

### The Growing Cost

Mental health medications represent a **significant and growing portion** of CatSalut's pharmaceutical expenditure. As prescriptions increase, so do costs—both to the public system and to patients through co-payments.

### The Government's Share

The data shows variation in how much the government covers for different medication types. Some nervous-system medications may have higher co-payment rates, creating **economic barriers to access**.

### The Inequality Question

The economic analysis raises critical questions:

- Do higher co-payments for certain medications create access barriers?
- Are there socioeconomic gradients in who gets which medications?
- How does the economic burden of mental health medications affect different demographic groups?

## Chapter 6: The Temporal Rhythms

Beyond the long-term trends, the data reveals **subtle temporal patterns**:

### Seasonality

- **Respiratory medications**: Show clear winter peaks (January-March) and summer lows—the expected pattern of seasonal infections
- **Nervous system medications**: Relatively stable across the year, but with a **small recurring uptick around March-April**
  - This may reflect post-winter symptom worsening
  - Increased visits after holiday periods
  - Seasonal affective disorder patterns

### The Long-Term Secular Trend

From 2016 to 2025, mental health prescriptions show a **consistent upward trajectory**, even before COVID-19. This reflects:

- **Increasing recognition** of mental health conditions
- **Reduced stigma** leading to more help-seeking
- **Expanding diagnostic criteria** and treatment guidelines
- **Aging population** (more people in age groups with higher mental health medication use)
- **Possibly increasing prevalence** of mental health conditions

The data cannot distinguish between these explanations—but it clearly shows that **mental health medications are becoming an increasingly central part of Catalunya's pharmacological landscape**.

## Chapter 7: The ATC Hierarchy Reveals Complexity

The ATC classification system allows us to **zoom in** from broad categories to specific drug classes:

### Level 1: The Organ System View

At the highest level, we see that **Sistema Nervioso** grows from near-invisibility in childhood to dominance in midlife and old age. It becomes one of the largest prescription categories, rivaling cardiovascular and metabolic medications.

### Level 2: The Therapeutic Group View

Within the nervous system, we see distinct life-stage patterns:

- **Analgesics**: Childhood and old age
- **Psychoanaleptics**: Adolescence and young adulthood
- **Psycholeptics**: Steady climb through midlife
- **Antiparkinsonians**: Late-life emergence

### Level 3: The Drug Class View

At the finest granularity, we see:

- **Antidepressants**: Peak in young adulthood, remain high in midlife
- **Anxiolytics**: Gradual rise through adulthood
- **Opioids**: Late-life spike for chronic pain
- **Anti-dementia drugs**: Very late-life appearance
- **ADHD medications**: Childhood and adolescence, with male bias

Each level of the hierarchy tells a different part of the story—from the broad sweep of organ systems to the specific drug classes that define each life stage.

## Chapter 8: The Policy Implications

The data story doesn't end with description—it points toward **actionable insights**:

### 1. The Prevention Opportunity

The data shows that mental health medications peak in young adulthood. This suggests that **early intervention and prevention programs** targeting adolescents and young adults could have significant impact. Rather than waiting for pharmacological need to emerge, we could:

- Expand school-based mental health programs
- Improve access to counseling and therapy (non-pharmacological interventions)
- Address social determinants (housing, employment, education)

### 2. The Gender Equity Question

The stark gender differences raise questions about:

- **Diagnostic equity**: Are we underdiagnosing mental health conditions in men?
- **Treatment equity**: Are we over-prescribing to women or under-prescribing to men?
- **Social determinants**: How do gender roles and expectations affect mental health needs?

### 3. The COVID-19 Legacy

The pandemic acceleration of mental health prescriptions suggests we need:

- **Expanded mental health capacity** to meet increased demand
- **Long-term monitoring** to see if prescription levels return to pre-pandemic trends or remain elevated
- **Support for healthcare workers** who faced unprecedented stress

### 4. The Regional Equity Challenge

Regional variations suggest we need to:

- **Investigate access barriers** in regions with lower prescription rates (under-treatment) or higher rates (over-treatment or higher need)
- **Ensure equitable distribution** of mental health resources
- **Understand local factors** that drive regional differences

### 5. The Aging Population

As Catalunya's population ages, the data suggests we need to prepare for:

- **Increasing polypharmacy** (multiple medications)
- **Complex medication management** in older adults
- **Specialized geriatric mental health services**
- **Support for caregivers** who manage complex medication regimens

## Epilogue: What the Data Cannot Tell Us

This data story is powerful, but it has **important limitations**:

### What We See vs. What We Don't

- **We see prescriptions, not diagnoses**: The data tells us what medications were prescribed, not the underlying conditions
- **We see filled prescriptions, not adherence**: A prescription doesn't mean the medication was taken
- **We see aggregated data, not individuals**: We cannot track individual journeys through the healthcare system
- **We see medications, not outcomes**: We don't know if these prescriptions improved health

### The Unseen Factors

The data cannot capture:

- **Non-pharmacological treatments**: Therapy, counseling, lifestyle interventions
- **Unmet need**: People who need medications but don't receive them
- **Over-treatment**: People who receive medications they may not need
- **Quality of care**: Whether the right medications are prescribed for the right conditions
- **Social determinants**: Poverty, housing, employment, social support

### The Ethical Dimensions

This data raises ethical questions:

- **Privacy**: Even aggregated, prescription data reveals sensitive information about population health
- **Stigma**: How do we discuss mental health medication use without reinforcing stigma?
- **Autonomy**: How do we balance public health insights with individual privacy?
- **Equity**: How do we ensure that data-driven insights lead to more equitable care, not more surveillance?

## Conclusion: The Prescription as a Signal

Every prescription in this dataset represents a moment of need—a person seeking help, a doctor making a decision, a system responding to demand. These moments form patterns that reveal something profound about how we live, age, and cope.

The data tells us that **mental health medications are not a marginal concern**—they are central to how modern societies manage health across the lifespan. From the painkillers of childhood to the complex polypharmacy of old age, from the gender divides to the regional variations, from the steady growth to the COVID-19 acceleration—the data reveals a transformation that is both medical and social.

This is not just a story about medications. It's a story about:

- **How we recognize and respond to mental health needs**
- **How aging reshapes our pharmacological landscape**
- **How crisis (COVID-19) amplifies existing vulnerabilities**
- **How gender and geography create different experiences of mental health**
- **How data can illuminate patterns that individual experience cannot see**

The prescription data is a **signal**—not a complete picture, but a powerful lens through which to understand how Catalunya cares for the mental health of its people. As we move forward, this data can guide policy, inform resource allocation, and help us build a healthcare system that responds not just to individual needs, but to the patterns that emerge when we look at the whole.
